## Self-hosting

Host National Boundaries and Addresses API of Lithuania on your own infrastructure.

### Docker Image

Here's an example of its usage with Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  national-boundaries-api:
    image: ghcr.io/govlt/national-boundaries-api:main
    pull_policy: always
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://127.0.0.1:80/health || exit 1" ]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      start_period: 5s
      retries: 5
```

Additional docker image environment options:

| Environment Variable | Default Value  | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SENTRY_DSN`         | ``             | The DSN for Sentry, used for error tracking and monitoring. Leave empty if Sentry is not used.                                                                              |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | `"production"` | Specifies the environment for Sentry (e.g., production, staging, development).                                                                                              |
| `ROOT_URL`           | ``             | The root URL of the application. Only change if the application is mounted below a specific URL path.                                                                       |
| `WORKERS`            | `1`            | If you have a cluster of machines with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or another similar system, handle replication at the cluster level and keep a single worker per container. |

### SQLite Database

Optionally, use the SQLite database with all boundaries and addresses directly without running the
national-boundaries-api. Download the latest database version [here](TODO).

## Getting Started Development

To embark on your development journey, follow these simple steps:

- **Install Python 3.12+:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Install Poetry 1.8+:** [Download Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- **Install GDAL 3.9+:** [Download GDAL](https://gdal.org/download.html) (Needed only for building the SQLite file on
  your computer)

After setting up a Python virtual environment and installing dependencies with Poetry, create the database by
executing `create-database.sh`. Then, run the development API:

```shell
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```
